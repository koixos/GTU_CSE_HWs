/*
										SOLUTION FOR TOWER OF HANOI PROBLEM
	
	- After making some tests and trials-and-errors to understand the logic behind this problem, I have found a pattern between next move and the number of blocks on a rod.
	- The pattern to set an algorithm:
		
		# start with 1st rod -
		# [ size = first->currentsize ]  
			> if mod(size, 2) is different from 0, then move the top block to 3rd rod
			> if mod(size, 2) is 0, move the top block to 2nd rod
			> check 1st rod until there is no possible popping - if there isnot remained any possible move on 1st rod,
		
			#Â pass to 2nd rod - 
			# [ size = second->currentsize ] 
				> if mod(size, 2) is different from 0, move the top block to 3rd rod
				> if mod(size, 2) is 0, move the top block to 1st rod
				> check 2nd rod till there is no possible moving - if there isnot any remained move on 2nd rod,
		
				# pass to 3rd rod -
				# [ size = third->currentsize ]
					> if mod(size, 2) is different from 0, move the top block to 2nd rod
					> if mod(size, 2) is 0, move the top block to 1st rod
					> check 3rd rod till there is no possible moving - if there isnot any remained move on 3rd rod,
					
					# go back to first rod and repeat this 'till the problem is done
	
	- We have to check some conditions throughout this algorithm to be able to solve the problem in minimum move.
	- Minimum number of move for any size is determined with this formula: [ total_movement = 2^size - 1 ]
	- These conditions should be checked on every move:
		
		$ whether destination->array[top] is bigger than the block wanted to move - if not, the block cannot be moved - top of destination should be bigger than top of source
		$ number of moves should be decreased by 1 with every move
		$ size of source rod should be bigger than 0 - meaning it cannot be empty
		$ if destination rod is empty any move can be made
		$ the latest moved block should be saved to a variable to avoid creating any kind of infinite loop,
			exp:
			-> block 1 is moved to 3rd rod from 1st rod,
			-> If there is no move on 2nd rod, the program will flow normally. But if we did not save the latest moved block, when the program comes to 3rd rod,
				it'll forget that the block 1 has been moved there in the previous move and it may try to move it to 1st rod again (if conditions are satisfied),
				and this will cause a probable loop.
			-> So we have to save the latest move to use it as a memory.
		
		$ if top of next source is equal to memory block which is saved from the previous move, there is no move as explained above
